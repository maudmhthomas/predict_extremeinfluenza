# Predict Extremes :influenza in France

This repository contains the R code attached to the paper "Predict extremes: influenza in France", M. Thomas and H. Rootz√©n included simulations of multivariate Generalized Pareto distributed vectors, fits of multivariate Generalized Pareto models and conditionnal predictions of exceedances of high thresholds.

### Description of the files:
Files are provided in the format Rmarkdown. To run them, please select in RStudio "run all the chunkes" to run them in the R console or "knit to html" to provide a hmtl file containing all the codes and all outputs.

FinalCode03102019.Rproj: R project. 
PredictEpidemicTools.Rmd: Rmarkdown file with all the R functions.
ILIincidences1985-2019.csv: Real data associated with the codes.
SimulatedDataWeek3.csv: simulated data for the prediction of Week 3.
SimulatedDataSize.csv: simulated data for the prediction of the Size.
GumbelSimulate.Rmd: Rmarkdown file to obtain the simulated data (SimulatedDataWeek3.csv and SimulatedDataSize.csv).
RunRealWeek3.Rmd: Rmarkdown file to produce all the results about the prediction of Week 3 from the real data.
RunRealSize.Rmd: Rmarkdown file to produce all the results about the prediction of Size from the real data.
RunSimulationsWeek3.Rmd: Rmarkdown file to produce all the results about the prediction of Week 3 from the simulated data.
RunSimulationsSize.Rmd: Rmarkdown file to produce all the results about the prediction of Size from the simulated data.

The codes	were built on R version 3.6.0.
